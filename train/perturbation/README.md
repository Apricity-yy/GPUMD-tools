# Machine Learning Potential Training Workflow: Data Preparation from perturbation (Phase2)

This workflow outlines the fundamental steps for generating training datasets for machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) from perturbations. The focus of the pipeline is to complement the atomic configurations obtained from the previous AIMD step and enrich the training set with accurate quantum mechanical reference data.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Apply perturbations to the lattice and atomic positions （using the perturbed.py）**  
   After generating any desired number of perturbed structures, batch calculations can be performed.
   - **VASP input file can refer the input_single_energy folder.**

2. **Batch DFT Calculations**  
   Perturbed configurations are automatically processed through high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations to obtain reference energies, forces, and stress tensors for MLIP training.
   - **Input files for high precision single point energy calculations can be found in the input_single_energy folder.**
   - **Highly accurate single-point energy calculations are performed on all perturbed structure batches (sh in_job.sh; sh jisuan.sh).**
   - **Check that high-precision single-point energy calculations for all perturbed structures converge normally (sh check.sh).**

## Implementation Notes
- Structures generated by perturbing the unit cell can be used in Phase2 calculations and added to the training dataset.
- Adjust perturbation magnitudes based on system properties
- Validate DFT convergence parameters before batch submissions
- Recommended workflow tools: ASE, VASP

This structured approach ensures generation of physically meaningful training data while maintaining computational feasibility for MLIP development.
